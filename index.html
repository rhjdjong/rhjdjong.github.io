            My name is Ruud de Jong.
            I have worked as software engineer, requirements engineer, software architect
            and related positions at various companies.
            For the major part of my career (1986 through 2001) I worked for
            Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs (first AT&T) on software development for the 5ESS telephone exchange.

            I studied theoretical physics at Rijksuniversiteit Leiden in the Netherlands.
            During that study I had my first contact with software, and I decided that would
            be the direction in which I would pursue a career.
            If a Computer Science study had existed a that time, I probably would have studied that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over the past 40+ years I have used many different programming languages.
            I started at university with Algol60, followed by APL and Fortran,
            and of course there was the ubiquitous Basic on my hobby computers.
            Later I worked with Pascal, C, C++, Java, and to a lesser extent C#, Lisp, Perl, and some others.
            But my favourite language for the last 20 years or so is Python.
